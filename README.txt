This program runs with ./server input.txt

Main is in quacker.c, not that this information is important.

I didn't realize that we were supposed to screenshot each part (I think that information was mentioned on the last page, which I didn't read until just now).

The test files I ran were edits to the provided ones. Mostly changing the sleep duration.
